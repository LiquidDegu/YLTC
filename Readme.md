## Automatically update YouTube thumbnail for livestreams
With this program, you can easily change the thumbnail for your YouTube livestreams.
It will take the VirtualCamera output from OBS and upload a new thumbnail to YouTube automatically.

## Change update time 
You can change the interval in which the YouTube thumbnail will get updated
**(_With the Youtube API you have 10,000 "Credits" daily; one thumbnail change costs 50 "Credits")_**.
Depending on how long you want to steam that day, you can change the interval of the thumbnail updates.

### Example
